This repository is part of my personal learning journey in exploring **Kubernetes** and related automation tools.  
Along the way, I also dive into **Ansible** as a complementary technology to automate infrastructure and application management.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies IT orchestration, configuration management, and application deployment.  
It allows you to define the desired state of your systems in simple YAML files called **playbooks**, which makes automation easy to write, read, and share.

With Ansible, you can:
- Automate repetitive tasks across multiple servers.
- Manage infrastructure consistently without manual intervention.
- Deploy applications faster with fewer errors.
- Integrate with Kubernetes and other cloud-native technologies for end-to-end automation.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
Through this repository, I aim to:
- Strengthen my understanding of Kubernetes fundamentals.  
- Explore how Ansible can be applied to automate Kubernetes workflows.  
- Build reusable templates, scripts, and documentation that can serve as references for future projects.
